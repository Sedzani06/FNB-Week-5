# 🧮 JavaScript Calculator App – FNB App Academy Week 5

Welcome to my Week 5 project for the FNB App Academy!  
In this milestone, I built a **fully functional calculator** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — combining everything I’ve learned so far into a responsive and interactive app.

## 💡 What I Learned and Applied

### ✅ HTML
- Created a structured calculator layout using a `<table>`
- Designed input and button elements for digits, operations, and reset

### ✅ CSS
- Styled the calculator for a clean, modern, and responsive look
- Used `vh` and `vw` units for layout adaptability
- Applied different colors for digit, operator, and action buttons

### ✅ JavaScript
- Used **event handlers** to respond to button clicks
- Implemented logic for:
  - Appending digits
  - Handling arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `x`, `/`)
  - Clearing input
  - Calculating and displaying results
- Managed variable scope, value storage, and input display behavior

## 🖥️ Features
- Performs basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- “AC” button clears the input
- Equal button evaluates the current expression
- Handles input cleanly (removes leading zero, resets after calculation)

## 📁 Files Included
- `index.html` – Structure of the calculator
- `style.css` – Styling of the calculator interface
- JavaScript embedded inside the HTML

This project has helped me reinforce my understanding of **JavaScript fundamentals** while building something practical and interactive.

Stay tuned as I keep leveling up!
